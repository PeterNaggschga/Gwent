## Overview

*Gwent - A Calculator* is an Android app ([available in Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peternaggschga.gwint)) 
that enables the user to play the Gwent card game from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt with analog cards.
This is accomplished by providing an easy-to-use interface which allows adding cards with certain
attributes that correspond to the cards played analogously. 
The app then calculates the power score of the player including weather effects and card abilities.
To see what this looks like, please visit the [Play Store entry](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peternaggschga.gwint)!

## Printing analog cards

To actually play Gwent using *Gwent - A Calculator*, you need to print out analog Gwent cards. The card images can be downloaded from the following links:

Please be aware that the Skellige faction is only available in the german
packages! [This PDF](https://peternaggschga.github.io/Gwent/printing-layout.pdf) summarizes in
which quantity you need to print which card.

When you installed the app, printed out your deck and found a friend, you are ready to go and can
start playing the original Gwent game from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.
